# MMore complex societies have more complex kinship lexicons
Sihan Chen, David Gil, Antonio Benitez-Burraco

This Github repository contains the data, the analysis script, and the figures in the paper.

## A description of the repository content

### data
This folder contains the data in our analysis:
- the dataset for the sociopolitical complexity index (SCI) of langugaes, calculated from 9 features drawn from Glottolog, Ethnologue, and D-Place databases (Hammarstr√∂m et al., 2022; Eberhard et al., 2022; Kirby et al., 2016): `compiled_table_20231213_pca.csv`
- phylogenical information of languages in the EDGE tree (Bouckaert et al., 2022): `EDGE6635-merged-relabelled.tree`
- phylogenical information of languages used in our analysis in the EDGE tree: `wrangled.tree`

### imgs
This folder contains the images generated:
- an illustration of kinship complexity of ~900 languages (languages in KinBank that have a match in the EDGE tree): `kinship_complexity_kinbank.pdf`
- visualization of kinship complexity vs. SCI: `main.pdf`
- a map of languages used in the analysis: `map.pdf`
- kinship complexity vs. SCI, by language family: `main_by_family.pdf`

### kinbank
The KinBank repository (shamelessly) stolen from Passmore's Github repository.

### output_table
Output generated by the R script.
- Kinship complexity calculate from the script: `complexity_new.csv`
- The main dataframe used for the regression: `main.csv`

### scripts
This folder contained the scripts conducting the analysis. Since the analysis was carried out on a computational cluster, for each script `*.R`, there's a bash script `*.sh` to run it on the cluster. 
- The main script in the analysis: `main.R`
